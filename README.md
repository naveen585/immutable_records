# immutable_records
 Create an immutable platform record by hashing snapshots with Ascon-Hash. Enhance security by digitally signing each hash with a timestamp using RSA. The resulting time-signature pairs ensure integrity and resist unauthorized modifications, offering stakeholders a transparent and trustworthy record.
